        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core programming languages that form the foundation of web development.
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structure of a webpage, defining elements such as headings,
        paragraphs, images, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and design the page, controlling
        colors, fonts, layouts, and overall visual presentation. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior,
        allowing developers to create features like animations, form validation, and interactive menus. Together, these
        languages work in harmony to build modern websites that are both visually appealing and highly functional,
        making them essential skills for anyone interested in creating digital experiences.</p>
